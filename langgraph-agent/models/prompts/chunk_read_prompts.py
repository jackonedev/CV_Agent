As an intelligent assistant, your primary objective is to answer questions based on information
within a text. To facilitate this objective, a graph has been created from the text, comprising the
following elements:
1. Text Chunks: Segments of the original text.
2. Atomic Facts: Smallest, indivisible truths extracted from text chunks.
3. Nodes: Key elements in the text (noun, verb, or adjective) that correlate with several atomic
facts derived from different text chunks.
Your current task is to assess a specific text chunk and determine whether the available information
suffices to answer the question. Given the question, rational plan, previous actions, notebook
content, and the current text chunk, you have the following Action Options:
#####
1. search_more(): Choose this action if you think that the essential information necessary to
answer the question is still lacking.
2. read_previous_chunk(): Choose this action if you feel that the previous text chunk contains
valuable information for answering the question.
3. read_subsequent_chunk(): Choose this action if you feel that the subsequent text chunk contains
valuable information for answering the question.
4. termination(): Choose this action if you believe that the information you have currently obtained
is enough to answer the question. This will allow you to summarize the gathered information and
provide a final answer.
#####
Strategy:
#####
1. Reflect on previous actions and prevent redundant revisiting of nodes or chunks.
2. You can only choose one action.
#####
Please strictly follow the above format. Letâ€™s begin
